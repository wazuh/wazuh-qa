    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: "As Snap packages utilizes squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ('App store'), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment."

This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer optical disc formats."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."

  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition.
  - id: 31003
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp mount for your environment will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount. For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/stab. Example using tmpfs with specific mount options: # tmpfs /tmp / tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0. Example using a volume or disk with specific mount options, The source location of the volumne or disk will vary depending on your environment: # <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

  # 1.4.1 Ensure bootloader password is set
  - id: 31036
    title: "Ensure bootloader password is set."
    description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters."
    rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
    impact: 'If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c". If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.'
    remediation: "Create an encrypted password with grub2-setpassword and the run the following commnad to update the grub2 configuration: # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg."

The grub configuration is usually located at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg and linked as /etc/grub2.cfg.  On newer grub2 systems the encrypted bootloader password is contained in /boot/grub2/user.cfg."
    rationale: "Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to set permissions on your grub configuration: # chown root:root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg    # chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grub.cfg # chown root:root /boot/grub2/grubenv    # chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grubenv  # chown root:root /boot/grub2/user.cfg  # chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/user.cfg     OR if the stystem uses UEFI, edit /etc/fstab and add the fmask=0077, uid=0 and gid=0 options.

While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development. Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future Note: you can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode.

    description: "Unconfined processes run in unconfined domains."
    rationale: "For unconfined processes, SELinux policy rules are applied, but policy rules exist that allow processes running in unconfined domains almost all access. Processes running in unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively. If an unconfined process is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security enhancement on top of DAC rules - it does not replace them."
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them. Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and documented before such an exception is made."

The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."
    rationale: "A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large response (7x to 28x amplification), which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If rpcbind is not required, it is recommended that the rpcbind package be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system."
    impact: "Many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization, and the nfs-utils package used for The Network File System (NFS), are dependent on the rpcbind package. If the rpcbind package is required as a dependency, the services rpcbind.service and rpcbind.socket should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove rpcbind: # dnf remove rpcbind OR If the rpcbind is required as a dependency, run the following command to stop and mask the rpcbind and rpcbind.socket services: # systemctl --now mask nfs-server && # systemctl --now mask rpcbind.socket."

    title: "Ensure SSH PAM is enabled."
    description: "The UsePAM directive enables the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) interface. If set to yes this will enable PAM authentication using ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication directives in addition to PAM account and session module processing for all authentication types."
    rationale: "When usePAM is set to yes, PAM runs through account and session types properly. This is important if you want to restrict access to services based off of IP, time or other factors of the account. Additionally, you can make sure users inherit certain environment variables on login or disallow access to the server."

  # 5.2.13 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled.
  - id: 31152
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured.
  - id: 31159
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. a) ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. b) ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3.  - The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel - Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk.  - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is no greater than 900 seconds (15 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 0  - At the 15 minute interval, if the ssh session is inactive, the session will be terminated."
    impact: "In some cases this setting may cause termination of long-running scripts over SSH or remote automation tools which rely on SSH. In developing the local site policy, the requirements of such scripts should be considered and appropriate ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings should be calculated to insure operational continuity."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. This should include ClientAliveInterval between 1 and 900 and ClientAliveCountMax of 0 ClientAliveCountMax 0."

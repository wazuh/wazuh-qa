# Test max_upload_size API option

## Overview 

Verify that a 413 status code (Request Entity Too Large) is returned if the body in an API request is bigger than `max_upload_size`, which is specified in the `api.yaml` file.

## Objective

- To confirm that `max_upload_size` is correctly applied so requests with bigger bodies can't be run.

# Test wazuh-agentd reconnection

## Overview

These tests will check if, during enrollment, the agent re-establishes communication with the manager
under different situations that interrupt it.

## Objective

The objective is to check that, with different states in the clients.key file, the agent
successfully enrolls after losing connection with remoted.

## Expected behavior

Success if the agent enrolls and starts communication with remoted, failure otherwise.

## Testing

The tests are based on verifying that `wazuh-agentd` is communicating with `wazuh-remoted` 
(if the agent is already enrolled), configuring `wazuh-remoted` to reject this connection, 
and finally verifying that the agent is enrolled again.

The above is done under the following states of the agent's `client.keys` file:
- It contains valid keys.
- It is empty.
- It does not exist.

### Checks

- **The agent has keys and loses communication with RemoteD.**
- **The agent does not have keys and loses communication with RemoteD when enrollment has been started.**
- **The agent does not have `client.keys` file and loses communication with RemoteD when enrollment has been started.**
- **The agent has keys, loses communication with RemoteD, and performs multiple enrollment requests.**
- **The agent does not have keys, RemoteD is unavailable for several seconds and multiple connection requests 
    are performed before a new enrollment is made.**

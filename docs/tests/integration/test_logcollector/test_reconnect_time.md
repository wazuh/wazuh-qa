# Test reconnect time

## Overview 

Check if Wazuh Windows agent reconnect to Windows event log channels using the specified `reconnect_time` 
option. These tests will disable Windows event log service and check that expected warning debugs are generated.
Then, system time is changed using `reconnect_time` value. After that, Wazuh should generate reconnect time debug log.

## Objective

- To confirm `reconnect_time` option works correctly.
- To confirm that Wazuh detect when Windows event log service is up.
- To confirm that Wazuh detect when Windows event log service is down.
- To confirm that Wazuh can reconnect to Windows event log service.

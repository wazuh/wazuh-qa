# Test multi agent protocols communication

## Overview

These tests will check if there is a correct communication between the manager and the agent after establishing `TCP`,
`UDP` or both as receiving and sending protocols, using several agents simultaneously.

## Objective

The objective is to check the manager correctly receives information from the agents via TCP, UDP and both
protocols simultaneously.

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 6 | 65.72s |

## Expected behavior
Success if the events have been found in the manager's `queue` socket after sending it from the agents, using different
protocols and ports. Failure otherwise.

## Testing

The testing is based on configuring the manager to receive messages via `TCP`, `UDP` and `TCP-UDP` as well
as using the default port and a custom port.

The process that is carried out is as follows:

- Create and register `n` agents in the manager.
- Launch two jobs in separate threads:
   - A monitoring job that is based on monitoring the manager's  `queue` socket to see the events received.
   - A job that sends a custom event for each agent.

### Checks

- TCP and port 1514.
- UDP and port 1514.
- TCP,UDP and port 1514.
- TCP and port 56000.
- UDP and port 56000.
- TCP,UDP and port 56000.

## Comments

An important aspect to take into account is the time needed by wazuh-remoted to reload the `client.keys`.
By default, it is **10 seconds**, but this option is configurable in the `internal_options.conf`, using the
following directive:

```
remoted.keyupdate_interval=2
```

The test itself waits until the info is loaded, so reducing this time will also reduce the test time.
It is recommended to set this time between 2 and 5 seconds.

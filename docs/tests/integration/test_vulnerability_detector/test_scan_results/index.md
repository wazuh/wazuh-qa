# Overview

## Objective

The purpose of testing providers' settings is to check if Vulnerability Detector generates alerts in the right cases.

## Expected behavior

After inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages, Vulnerability Detector has to generate the alerts. Some
considerations to take into account:

- NVD must be enabled in `ossec.conf` for scanning vulnerability alerts.
- At least one vulnerability needs to be inserted in the NVD and `vulnerabilities` tables to generate vulnerability
alerts.

## Testing

### Generic tests

- **[test_alert_vulnerability_removal](test_alert_vulnerability_removal.md#test-alert-vulnerability-removal)**:
Test that adds a simulated agent to the system with two test packages containing vulnerabilities then starts 
a `BASELINE` scan and, after finishing it, removes the first package and updates the second one to a non-vulnerable 
version. It then launches a `PARTIAL_SCAN` and checks if alerts have been generated for these package operations.

- **[test_debian_inventory_debian_feed](test_debian_inventory_debian_feed.md#test-debian-inventory-debian-feed)**:
Tests that mock Debian systems and insert custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to check if Vulnerability
Detector generates alerts from Debian provider feed.

- **[test_redhat_inventory_redhat_feed](test_redhat_inventory_redhat_feed.md#test-red-hat-inventory-red-hat-feed)**:
Tests that mock RedHat systems and insert custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to check if Vulnerability
Detector generates alerts from RedHat provider feed.

- **[test_ubuntu_inventory_canonical_feed](test_ubuntu_inventory_canonical_feed.md#test-ubuntu-inventory-canonical-feed)**:
Tests that mock Ubuntu systems and insert custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to see if Vulnerability Detector
generates alerts from Canonical provider feed.

- **[test_scan_nvd_feed](test_scan_nvd_feed.md#test-scan-nvd-feed)**: Tests that mock RedHat,
Ubuntu, Debian and Windows systems, and insert custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to check if Vulnerability
Detector generates alerts from NVD feed.

- **[test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed](test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed.md#test-scan-providers-and-nvd-feed)**:
Tests that mock RedHat, Ubuntu and Debian systems, and insert custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to check
if Vulnerability Detector generates alerts from NVD and providers feed.

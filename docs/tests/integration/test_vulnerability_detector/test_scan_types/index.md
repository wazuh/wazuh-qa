# Overview

## Objective

The purpose of testing general settings is to check the scan types of the Vulnerability Detector module are working as
expected. These are the general scan types:

- `PARTIAL_SCAN`

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 1 | 0:02:40  |

## Expected behavior

- `PARTIAL_SCAN`: Alerts should be generated only for vulnerabilities detected in new packages installed during 
  this kind of scanning.

## Testing

### Generic tests

- **[test_partial_scan_type](test_partial_scan_type.md#test-partial-scan-type)**:
  Test that adds a simulated agent to the system with a test package containing a vulnerability then starts 
  a `BASELINE` scan and, after finishing it, adds a new test package with another vulnerability. 
  It then launches a `PARTIAL_SCAN` and checks that the alert has only been generated for the last package installed.

# Test baseline scan type

The test will check if the Vulnerability Detector module performs the `BASELINE` scan type correctly.

## General info

## Test logic

The manager is configured to use custom feeds that include a vulnerability associated with a test package. This package
is added to the database of the simulated agent and, after enrollment of the agent, the vulnerability detector must
launch the first scan on it, which is of `BASELINE` type.

When the scan is done, we verify the vulnerability has been detected and no alerts have been generated for such
vulnerability in their respective logs.

## Checks

- [x] The `BASELINE` scan startup, checking messages in the logs file.
- [x] The NVD vulnerability for the test package is detected during the scan, checking messages in the logs file.
- [x] Completion of baseline scan, checking messages in the logs file.
- [x] No alert is generated for the vulnerability detected during scanning, checking messages in the alerts file.

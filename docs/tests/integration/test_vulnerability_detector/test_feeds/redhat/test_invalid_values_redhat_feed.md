# Test invalid values Red Hat feed

Set of tests to check the behavior of Vulnerability Detector when the value of a tag is not correct: invalid type,
strange characters...

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 131 | 0::21:26 | [test_invalid_values_redhat_feed.py](../../../test_feeds/redhat/test_invalid_values_redhat_feed.py)|

## Test logic

For each of the feed fields:

```
[CVE, severity, public_date, advisories, bugzilla, bugzilla_description,
 cvss_score, cvss_scoring_vector, CWE, affected_packages, resource_url,
cvss3_scoring_vector, cvss3_score]
```

is assigned the following values:

```
[None, "", "dummy value", 12345, ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'], "ñ", "テスト",
 "ИСПЫТАНИЕ", "测试", "اختبار"]
```

For example:

```
"CVE": None, "CVE": "", "CVE": "dummy_value" ...
```

## Tests

- `test_no_feed_changes`: Check the original feed is successfully imported.
- `test_invalid_values_redhat_feed`: The tests are based on modifying the feed assigning strange values.

## Checks

- [x] The original feed is successfully imported.
- [x] Vulnerabilities are inserted into the `vulnerabilities` database.
- [x] Action status message displayed in `ossec.log`.
- [x] `wazuh-modulesd` is still running once the test has finished (it didn't crash).

## Observed behavior

The feed will not be imported if:

- A key field has not the expected type.

  ```
   key_fields = ['CVE', 'bugzilla_description', 'affected_packages']
  ```

> Note: A key field is one that needs to be present in the feed in order to be imported*

For other cases, the feed will be imported successfully.

**Comments**

Marked as **expected fail** when `affected_packages` is modified due to vulnerabilities have not been imported but the
opposite is shown in `ossec.log`. Related issue https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/5272

> Note: **expected fail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason. A common example is a test for a feature
not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed.

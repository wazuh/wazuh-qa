# Test missing fields Red Hat feed

Set of tests to check the behavior of Vulnerability Detector when a field is missing in the feed.

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 14 | 0:02:12 | [test_missing_fields_redhat_feed.py](../../../test_feeds/redhat/test_missing_fields_redhat_feed.py)|

## Test logic

Each test consists of removing one of the following fields from the feed:

```
['CVE', 'severity', 'public_date', 'advisories', 'bugzilla',
 'bugzilla_description', 'cvss_score', 'cvss_scoring_vector',
 'CWE', 'affected_packages', 'resource_url', 'cvss3_scoring_vector',
 'cvss3_score']
```

## Tests

- `test_no_feed_changes`: Check the original feed is successfully imported.
- `test_missing_fields_redhat_feed`: The tests will remove a field from the feed.

## Checks

- [x] The original feed is successfully imported.
- [x] Vulnerabilities are inserted into the `vulnerabilities` database.
- [x] Action status message displayed in `wazuh.log`.
- [x] `wazuh-modulesd` is still running once the test has finished (it didn't crash).

## Observed behavior

The feed will not be imported if:

- There is a missing key field:

  ```
  key_fields = ['CVE', 'bugzilla_description', 'affected_packages']
  ```

For other cases, the feed will be imported successfully.

**Comments**

Marked as **expected fail** when `affected_packages` is missing due to vulnerabilities have not been imported but the
opposite is shown in `wazuh.log`. Related issue https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/5272

> Note: **expected fail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason. A common example is a test for a feature
not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed.

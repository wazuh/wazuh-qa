    An abstract base class for instances.

    This class provides an interface for starting, reloading, stopping, deleting, and getting the status of instances.
    It also provides a method to get SSH connection information for the instance.

    Attributes:
        path (Path): The path of the instance.
        identifier (str): The identifier of the instance.
        credentials (Credentials): The credentials of the instance.

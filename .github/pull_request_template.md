## Testing performed

<!-- At most there can only be this table. It must be updated if a new test has been performed. It is important to update the commit that has been tested! -->
<!-- Notes: 
    - If you use a package, add its version, otherwise remove the section.
    - If you add documentation or something that does not require running a test, remove the section.

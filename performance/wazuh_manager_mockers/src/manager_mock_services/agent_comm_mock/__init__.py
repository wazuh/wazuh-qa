r"""Manager Agent Comm API Mocker.

This package provides a mock server designed to handle agent authentication and manage events sent by agents.
It uses FastAPI as the web framework and SQLite for storing agent data. The mock server simulates the
behavior of a real agent communication server, making it a valuable tool for testing and development.

### Features:
- Agent authentication handling.
- Event management and storage using SQLite.
- FastAPI-based server implementation.
- SSL support for secure communication.
- Metrics logging to CSV for tracking server activity.

### Usage:
To start the mock server, run the following command:

```shell
python agent_comm_mock.py --database-path /path/to/db \
    --port 8000 \
    --cert /path/to/cert \
    --key /path/to/key \
    --report-path /path/to/metrics.csv \
    --api-version /v1

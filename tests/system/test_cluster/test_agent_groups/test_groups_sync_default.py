brief: These tests check that when a cluster has a series of agents registered and connecting one after the other,
       and it is unable to do a Sync, that after a expected time, a Sync is forced and the DB is Synched.

    description: Check that after a long time when the manager has been unable to synchronize de databases, because
    new agents are being continually added, database synchronization is forced and the expected information is in
    all nodes after the expected sync time. For this, an agent is restarted and connects to the agent every roughly 10
    seconds, during 400 seconds. After all agents have been registered, it is checked that the wazuhDB has been synched
    in all the cluster nodes.

type: integration

brief: These tests will check if the cache feature of the API handled by the `wazuh-apid` daemon
       is working properly. The Wazuh API is an open source `RESTful` API that allows for interaction
       with the Wazuh manager from a web browser, command line tool like `cURL` or any script
       or program that can make web requests.

                 Calls to rules endpoints can be cached. This test verifies if the result
                 of the first call to the rule endpoint is equal to the second call within
                 a period established in the configuration, even though a new file
                 has been created during the process.

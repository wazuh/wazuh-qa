# Test invalid syntax Canonical feed

Set of tests that are based on checking the behavior of vulnerability detector when the feed has some kind of syntactic
error: it doesn't have a closing tag, it's missing some character ...

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 83 | 0:13:16 | [test_invalid_syntax_canonical_feed.py](../../../test_feeds/canonical/test_invalid_syntax_canonical_feed.py)|

## Test logic

A test is performed for each of the following cases:

- Delete `<`.
- Delete `>`.
- Delete `<>`.
- Close initial tag.
- Delete opening tag.
- Delete closing tag.
- Empty opening tag.
- Empty closing tag.
- Random text before tag.
- Delete info.

In addition, It has been added new tests with different characters.

```
['.', ':', '@', '#', '*', '-', '_', "'", '"', '/', '=', 'ñ', 'ç', '+', '^',
 '!', '?', '%', '&', '`', '¿', '?', '(', ')', '|', 'º', '$', '½', '¬',  '!',
 '~', '¡', '[', ']', '{', '}']
```

In this case, for each of the following characters, a test is performed in which:
 - Replace the symbol `<` with the character.
 - Add the character before an opening tag (`<`).

## Tests

- `test_no_feed_changes`: Check that the feed is imported successfully with the original feed.
- `test_invalid_syntax_canonical_feed`: The tests are based on modifying the feed causing syntax errors.

## Checks

- [x] Feed is imported successfully with the original feed.
- [x] Vulnerabilities are inserted into the `vulnerabilities` database.
- [x] Action status message displayed in `ossec.log`.
- [x] `Modulesd` is running after the test (don't crash).

## Observed behaviour

The feed will not be imported if:

- Delete `<`.
- Delete `>`.
- Delete `<>`.
- Close initial tag.
- Delete opening tag.
- Delete closing tag.
- Empty opening tag.
- Empty closing tag.
- Delete info.
- Replace `<` with other character.

For other cases, the feed will be imported successfully.

# Test validate feed content

Tests that are based on downloading the feeds of all providers and verifying that the format of each feed is as
expected and that the content of the feed is also `XML` or `JSON` parseable.

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 27 | 0:04:18 | [test_validate_feed_content.py](../../../test_feeds/test_validate_feed_content.py)|

## Test logic

First it is downloaded all the feeds shown below:

- `Red Hat`: page 1 from Red Hat feed.
- `Canonical`: focal, bionic, xenial, trusty.
- `Debian`: buster, stretch, jessie, wheezy.
- `NVD`: from 2002 to current year feed.

Next, the feed is checked for correct formatting and is parseable by `XML` or `JSON`.

## Checks

- [x] Feeds have the expected extension.
- [x] Feeds are `JSON` or `XML` parseable.

## Observed behaviour

Feeds are correctly validated.

## Execution result

# Test scan providers and NVD feed

Tests that are based on mocking Red Hat, Canonical and Debian systems, and inserting custom vulnerabilities and
vulnerable packages to see if vulnerability detector generates the vulnerability alerts from NVD and providers feed.

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 11 | 0:04:22 | [test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed.py](../../test_scan_results/test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed.py)|

## Test logic

For each of the following systems:

```
Red Hat --> RHEL8, RHEL7, RHEL6, RHEL5
Debian --> BUSTER, STRETCH, JESSIE, WHEEZY
Ubuntu --> BIONIC, XENIAL, TRUSTY
```

the following is done:

- Clean NVD, `vulnerabilities` and `sys_programs tables`.
- Mock system.
- Insert **simulated** provider vulnerabilities in `vulnerabilities` table, simulating having imported a feed from a
  provider.
- Insert NVD **simulated** [vulnerable packages](../../test_scan_results/data/vulnerabilities.json) and provider
  **simulated** [vulnerable packages](../../test_scan_results/data/vulnerabilities.json)
- Import NVD **simulated** vulnerabilities from [custom NVD feed](../../test_scan_results/data/custom_nvd_feed.json).
- Check the following events in `ossec.log`:

  - For each provider vulnerability, check:

    ```
    The '{package}' package .* from agent .* is vulnerable to '{cve}'
    ```

  - For each NVD vulnerability other than Red Hat system:

    ```
    The '{package}' package .* from agent .* is vulnerable to '{cve}'
    ```

  - Finally, it is checked the number of alerts that have been reported by NVD and by the provider.

    ```
    A total of '{provider_vulnerabilities_number}' vulnerabilities have been reported for agent '.*' " +
            "thanks to the 'vendor' feed.
    A total of '{nvd_vulnerabilities_number}' vulnerabilities have been reported for agent '.*' " +
            "thanks to the 'NVD' feed.
    ```

## Checks

- [x] As many NVD and provider alerts are generated as there are vulnerabilities.
- [x] There is 0 NVD vulnerability alerts for Red Hat provider.
- [x] The expected number of reported alerts is generated for NVD and provider.

## Observed behaviour

The expected behavior is carried out.

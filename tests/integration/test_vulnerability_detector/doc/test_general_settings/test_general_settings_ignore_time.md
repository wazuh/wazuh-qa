# Test general settings ignore time

Tests that are based on modifying the value of `ignore_time` tag in `ossec.conf`, setting different times and checking
the result in `ossec.log`.

## General info

|Tier | Number of tests | Time spent| Test file |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 3 | 0:02:04 | [test_general_settings_ignore_time.py](../../test_general_settings/test_general_settings_ignore_time.py)|

## Test logic

For 3 different time units:

```
[3600s, 60m, 1h]
```

the following is done:

- Insert a custom vulnerability and vulnerable package.
- Check the initial vulnerability alert.
- Advance the time clock before the set time and check that the alert has not been generated.
- Advance the time clock just after the set time and check that the alert has been generated.

## Checks

- [x] Vulnerabilities alerts are not generated before `ignore_time` time set.
- [x] Vulnerabilities alerts are generated after `ignore_time` time set.

## Observed behaviour

The expected behavior is carried out

## Execution result

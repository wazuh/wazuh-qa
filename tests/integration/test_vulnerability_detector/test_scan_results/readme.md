# Test scan results

## Objective

The purpose of testing providers settings is to check if the vulnerability detector generates alerts in the
appropriate cases.

## Expected behavior

After inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages, vulnerability detector has to generate vulnerability
alerts. Some considerations to take into account:

- It is necessary that NVD is enabled in `ossec.conf` for scanning vulnerability alerts.
- At least one vulnerability needs to be inserted in the NVD and `vulnerabilities` tables to generate vulnerability
alerts.

## Testing

### Generic tests

- **[test_debian_inventory_debian_feed](../doc/test_scan_results/test_debian_inventory_debian_feed.md)**: Tests that
are based on mocking debian systems and inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to see if vulnerability
detector generates the vulnerability alerts from Debian provider feed.

- **[test_redhat_inventory_redhat_feed](../doc/test_scan_results/test_redhat_inventory_redhat_feed.md)**: Tests that are
based on mocking redhat systems and inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to see if vulnerability
detector generates the vulnerability alerts from Red Hat provider feed.

- **[test_ubuntu_inventory_canonical_feed](../doc/test_scan_results/test_ubuntu_inventory_canonical_feed.md)**: Tests
that are based on mocking ubuntu systems and inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to see if
vulnerability detector generates the vulnerability alerts from Canonical provider feed.

- **[test_scan_nvd_feed](../doc/test_scan_results/test_scan_nvd_feed.md)**: Tests that are based on mocking Red Hat,
Canonical, Debian and Windows systems, and inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to see if
vulnerability detector generates the vulnerability alerts from NVD feed.

- **[test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed](../doc/test_scan_results/test_scan_providers_and_nvd_feed.md)**: Tests that are
based on mocking Red Hat, Canonical and Debian systems, and inserting custom vulnerabilities and vulnerable packages to
see if vulnerability detector generates the vulnerability alerts from NVD and providers feed.

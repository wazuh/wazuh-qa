# Tests vulnerability detector

Wazuh is able to detect vulnerabilities in the applications installed in agents using the `Vulnerability Detector` module. This software audit is performed through the integration of vulnerability feeds indexed by `Canonical`, `Debian`, `Red Hat`, and the `National Vulnerability Database`.


This directory includes all the integration tests developed to test the correct functioning of this module.

These tests can be classified into the following:

- **[test_feeds](test_feeds)**: Tests that check the behavior of the vulnerability detector when a feed with an unexpected content/type is imported, feeds downloads...

- `test_general_settings`: Tests that check the basic configuration of the vulnerability detector in the `ossec.conf`.

- `test_providers`: Tests that check the configuration of the vulnerability detector providers in the `ossec.conf`.

- `test_scan_results`: Tests that check if the vulnerability detector generates alerts in the appropriate cases.

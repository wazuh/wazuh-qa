brief: The 'wazuh-agentd' program is the client-side daemon that communicates with the server.
       The objective is to check that, with different states in the 'clients.keys' file,
       the agent successfully enrolls after losing connection with the 'wazuh-remoted' daemon.
       The wazuh-remoted program is the server side daemon that communicates with the agents.

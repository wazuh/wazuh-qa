brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts
       when these files are modified. In particular, these tests will check if FIM changes
       the monitoring mode from 'realtime' to 'scheduled' when it is not supported.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured
       files for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Check if the current OS platform falls to the 'scheduled' mode when 'realtime' is not available.
                 For this purpose, the test performs a CUD set of operations to a file with 'realtime' mode set as
                 the monitoring option in the 'ossec.conf' file. Firstly it checks for the initial 'realtime' event
                 appearing in the logs, and if the current OS does not support it, wait for the initial FIM scan
                 mode. After this, the set of operations takes place and the expected behavior is the events will be
                 generated with 'scheduled' mode and not 'realtime' as it is set in the configuration.

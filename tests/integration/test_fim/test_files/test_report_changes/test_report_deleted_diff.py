brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when
       these files are modified. Specifically, these tests will check if FIM manages properly
       the 'diff' folder created in the 'queue/diff/local' directory when removing a monitored
       folder or the 'report_changes' option is disabled.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured
       files for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

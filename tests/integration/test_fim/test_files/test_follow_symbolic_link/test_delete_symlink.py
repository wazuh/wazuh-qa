brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when these files
       are modified. Specifically, these tests will check if FIM stops detecting events when deleting
       the monitored 'symbolic link'.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files for
       changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

    description: Check if the 'wazuh-syscheckd' stops detecting events when deleting the monitored symlink.
                 For this purpose, the test will monitor a 'symbolic link' pointing to a file/directory, and
                 once FIM starts, it will create and expect events inside the pointed folder. After
                 these events are processed, the test will remove the 'symbolic link' and wait until the links
                 are reloaded. Then, it will create files inside the target that the link was pointing to and check
                 that no events are triggered. Finally, the test will restore the link, generate events inside
                 the target folder and verify that the FIM events have been generated.

"""
Remote Operations Module.
-------------------------

This module provides functions for launching remote operations on hosts and managing vulnerability checks.

It utilizes the Wazuh testing framework, including the HostManager class for handling
remote hosts and various tools for indexer API interactions.

Functions:
    - launch_remote_operation: Launch a remote operation on a specified host.
    - check_vuln_state_index: Check the vulnerability state index for a host.
    - check_vuln_alert_indexer: Check vulnerability alerts in the indexer for a host.
    - check_vuln_alert_api: Check vulnerability alerts via API for a host.
    - launch_parallel_operations: Launch parallel remote operations on multiple hosts.
